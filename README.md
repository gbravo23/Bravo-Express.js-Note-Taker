# Bravo Express.js Note Taker

This week I created an application called Bravo Express.js Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The purpose of this application is to be able to write and save notes so that the user can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks needed to be completed. 

When the user opens the app they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the user clicks on the link, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right hand column. The user can create new note titles and texts and use the save icon to save the created notes. The saved created notes will be displayed on the left-hand column and can be deleted by pressing the delete (trash) icon.

This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The entire application has been deployed to Heroku.
